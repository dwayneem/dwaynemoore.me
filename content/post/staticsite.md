I decided that I wanted to try out some new things to start the new year. So I've moved my web site from WordPress to being a static web site. Generated by [Hugo](https://gethugo.io). Deployed using [Github](https://github.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

Basically everything that I needed to know I learned from the LinkedIn Learning course ["Learning Static Site Building With Hugo"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-static-site-building-with-hugo-2).
