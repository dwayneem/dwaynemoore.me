## I’m a Customer Support Professional seeking a position in tech.

I have consistently demonstrated my passion and dedication to ensuring the success of customers throughout my twenty years of customer-facing experience in the computer software industry. I’ve delivered highly effective solutions to customers’ concerns by collaborating across development, test, and management teams. I’ve delivered customer support and training, both on-site and remotely. I’ve helped my customer-facing peers in support and sales to be more effective in their roles by increasing their product knowledge.

I believe that Customer Support is the key to the success or failure of any tech company.
